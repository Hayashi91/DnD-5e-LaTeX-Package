# D&D 5e LaTeX Template

This is an attempt at a D&D 5e LaTeX template. The color scheme is close to the original source books, as are the fonts. The fonts chosen are included by default in TeX Live.

The template compiles with pdflatex.

### Installation

Just clone the repo. From terminal:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/anoderay/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template.git 5e-template
$ cd 5e-template
$ pdflatex example.tex
```

If you don't have LaTeX installed, the following should help you out:
#### Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```
#### Arch
```sh
sudo pacman -S texlive-bin texlive-core texlive-latexextra
```
It's a bit unclear exactly what subset of features this module needs. As a general rule, we'd recommend installing one of larger ones.

### Package Options
- bg-letter: Loads a letter-sized background-image
- bg-a4: Loads an A4-sized background-image
- bg-print: Loads a printer-friendly background-image (only decal at the bottom)
- bg-full: Loads the full background-image

Per default "bg-letter" and "bg-full" are loaded.

### Todo's

 - Consider implementing more complex tables for monsters, etc.
 - Clean up the table-preset
 - Create more elegant solution for spacing before and after boxes (using \vspace is rather rigid when two boxes follow in a row)
 - Add subtitle option for boxes
 - Sort out box-decals when boxes break column or page
 - Look into adding the ability to add large images to the document. There are some documents made with InDesign out there that accomplish this quite well.
