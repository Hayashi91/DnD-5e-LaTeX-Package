# D&D 5e LaTeX Template

This is an attempt at a D&D 5e LaTeX template. The color scheme is close to the original source books, as are the fonts. The fonts chosen are included by default in TeX Live.

The template compiles with pdflatex.

### Package Options
- bg-letter: Loads a letter-sized background-image
- bg-a4: Loads an A4-sized background-image
- bg-print: Loads a printer-friendly background-image (only decal at the bottom)
- bg-full: Loads the full background-image

Per default "bg-letter" and "bg-full" are loaded.

### Notes
 - This is essentially a branch of https://github.com/anoderay/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template.git, but when I first got it I wasn't using git or GitHub so it's just my local copy added to my own repository.
 - I am new to using git and GitHub so please be patient with me, if I have done anything wrong please tell me how to correct my mistake.
